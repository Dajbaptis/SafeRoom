# SafeRoom
This project is a device that measures temperature, humidity, and CO levels in a given room. These measurements will be displayed on a LCD screen so that the user can 
have easy access. If CO levels get past a certain threshold (>80ppm) an alarm will sound off via a speaker to capture the user's attention. There will also be suggestions
on the LCD to bring CO levels back to a safe value.
